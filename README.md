This project exemplifies the equations of motion to create a controller for a quadrotor to accomplish the goals written in the performance requirements. This included hovering above ground for an allotted amount of time, flying in a circle of a designated radius and height, and following a set flight path. This was done with all engineering requirements maintained and by properly addressing realistic constraints of the quadcopter. Understanding what is required to precisely describe and control a vehicle like a quadcopter is essential for smoothly integrating aerospace vehicles into society for purposes other than traditional transportation.
